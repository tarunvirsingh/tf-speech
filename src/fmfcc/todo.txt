time shift


Question:
how many unknown samples
leave unknown words as original labels?

use bigger batches

- first get silence samples
- then train with noise
- then time shift


- no unknown in training. Only at the end at test time
  Because, if 'bed' comes, it might not excite the unknown, but might excite it's own neuron

- more training for off, stop, up, go


- optimization algo

Change learning rate decay
need bigger decay


can mfcc work on 0-1 audio?

why are eval and testing results so different?
