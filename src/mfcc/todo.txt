use bck gnd noise only in training
background
time shift
silence
input reset every iteration. so use at least one epoch per iteration

for a given filename, mix in bck noise
for each epoch, the mixing of bck noise should be random

generate samples for silence
genarate samples for unknown

Question:
how many unknown samples
leave unknown words as original labels?

use bigger batches

- first get silence samples
- then train with noise
- then time shift

- fix silence. My train and eval silence is 0. Test silence is not

- no unknown in training. Only at the end at test time
  Because, if 'bed' comes, it might not excite the unknown, but might excite it's own neuron

- more training for off, stop, up, go

- implement dropout
- optimization algo

Change learning rate decay
need bigger decay

make training faster
